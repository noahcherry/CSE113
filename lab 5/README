PURPOSE:
    zombie: to learn about using structures and arrays together with sscanf mostly.


PSEUDO CODE:
get_time:
    //gets day and time for zombie encounter
    str t
    fgets(t, 10, stdin)
    sscanf(t,"%d:%d:%d", hour, min, sec)

    str t
    fgets(t, 10, stdin)
    sscanf(t,"%d", day)
    

get_toes:
    //get toes element for structure
    str t
    fgets(t, 10, stdin)
    sscanf(t,"%d", toes)


get_blood:
    //get blood element for structure
    str t
    fgets(t, 10, stdin)
    sscanf(t,"%d", blood)


print_data:
    //prints all stored data from structure element
    print(log[encounter].dead)
    if dead == yes
        print(log[encounter].toes)
    else
        print(log[encounter].blood)
    print(log[encounter].day, log[encounter].hour, log[encounter].min, log[encounter].sec)

CONCLUSIONS:
    a)what i learned
        structures can be used with arrays to store data in a sort of data-ception

    b)what to fix / bugs and how i fixed
        print_data() isn't gramatically correct if there is only one toe.
        print_data() used to incorperate the count variable from main() but that 
                caused problems printing all the data once it cycled back to log[0]
