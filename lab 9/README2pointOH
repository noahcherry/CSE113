PURPOSE:
        To explore the wonders of dynamically allocated memory.
        To better understand the singly linked list data structure.

PSEUDO CODE:
        create_node(nodename) {
                malloc -> nodename
                nodename->data = NULL
                nodename->next = NULL
        }

        print_node(node) {
                print(node->data, node->next) 
        }

        insert_head(node, head) {
                node->next = head
                head -> node
                return head
        }

        insert_middle(node, head, index) {
                while(i < index)
                        head = head->next

                node->next = head->next
                head->next = node
        }

        insert_tail(node, head) {
                while(head->next != NULL)
                        head = head->next

                head->next = node
        }

        print_list(head) {
                while head != NULL
                        print( data, &node, &node->next)
                        node = node->next
        }

        delete_value(value, head, tail) {
                position = head
                while position->next != NULL
                        if position->data = value
                                delete_node(position,tail)
                        position = position->next
                return head
        }

    delete_node(node, tail) {
        free( node )
        while I <= tail->position
            if Inode->next == node
                Inode->next == node->next
    }

    delete_list(head, tail, position) {
        while position->next != NULL
            if position->next = tail
                free tail
                tail = position
                position = head
                delete_list(head, tail, position)
            
            position = position->next
            count++
        return head
    }


CONCLUSIONS:
        a)what i learned
                free what you allocate. dont try to free memory outside of the list.
                segmentations faults wont ever not be a thing.
                simple menu sysems are better than the alternative of complex menu systems.

        b)what to fix / bugs and how i fixed
                I really hate the menu system that I made. 
                The delete list used to seg fault when no nodes had been made.
