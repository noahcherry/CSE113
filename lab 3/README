Pseudo Code:
    Less than:
        //counts the number of elements in an array
        // that are less than x
        //A[1...N], an array with N elements
        count = 0
        for i = 1 to N
            if A[i] < x
                count = count + 1

    Less than or equal to:
        //counts the number of elements in an array
        // that are less than or equal to x
        //A[1...N], an array with N elements
        count = 0
        for i = 1 to N
            if A[i] <= x
                count = count + 1

    Greater than to:
        //counts the number of elements in an array
        // that are greater than or equal to x
        //A[1...N], an array with N elements
        count = 0
        for i = 1 to N
            if A[i] > x
                count = count + 1

    Greater than or equal to:
        //counts the number of elements in an array
        // that are greater than x
        //A[1...N], an array with N elements
        count = 0
        for i = 1 to N
            if A[i] >= x
                count = count + 1

    Reverse an array:
        //swaps items in an array to reverse it
        //
        //A[1...N], an array with N elements
        for i = 1 to N/2
            tmp = A[i]
            A[i] = A[N - (i - 1)]
            A[N - (i - 1)] = tmp
            
    Count number of evens:
        //adds 1 to count for every even element in
        //A[1...N], an array with N elements
        count = 0
        for i = 1 to N
            if A[i] mod 2 == 0
                count = count + 1

    Count number of odds:
        //adds 1 to count for every odd element in
        // A[1...N], an array with N elements
        count = 0
        for i = 1 to N
            if A[i] mod 2 == 1
                count = count + 1
        
    Count of numbers in an array divisible by x:
        //adds 1 to count for every element divisible by given number, x
        //A[1...N], an array with N elements
        count = 0
        for i = 1 to N
            if A[i] mod x == 0
                count = count + 1
