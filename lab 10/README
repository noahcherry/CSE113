Lab 10

Purpose:
    learning how to manipulate doubly linked lists.

Conclusions
    a) What I learned form this lab:
        how to code while crying.
        how adding a simple idea complicates previously simple code.
        how a tracking structure can be both helpful and a hinderance.
        that one sould be sure to work in that same directory as one is compiling in
        
    b)Issues and how I fixed them:    
        wouldn't compile. was working in the wrong directory.
        

    c)Improvements to be made
        an error element in the cpu_t struct would be nice.
        I am missing a free(). no idea what it is.

        

Compairasons
        doubly linked lists are quicker to navigate and much more convinent if you only intend to change the end bits.
        they are also twice as expensive, memory wise, as singly linked lists though this doesnt matter to us too much right now.
