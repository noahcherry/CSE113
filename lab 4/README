Lab 4

Purpose: To bend the arrays and structures to our malevolent will

Pseudo-Code:

Conclusions:
a) What I learned form this lab:
        for loops and arrays are complimentary.

b)Issues and how I fixed them:
        forgetting vector.h in multiple files leads to problems. 
        the array reverse was frustrating as I used the size variable to swap and couldn't propperly print the array after the swapping

c)Improvements to be made
        in vector.c, eigth_problem() only generates an array of size 10.
        utilize the year element in the zodiac problem.
