        A structure can bind together loosely-related variables. 
This is better to keep related but heterogeneous information together. 
Examples might be medical data like height, age, and weight.
        arrays can keep large amounts of data that can be iterated through. 
This is useful for statistics. Keeping things together like speed measurements can be useful here for easily finding averages.
        In short, structures are for heterogeneous data, arrays are for homogenous data.
